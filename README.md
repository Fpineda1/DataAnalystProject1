# DataAnalystProject1
Project 1 from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree
In this project I wrote a SQL query to extract data from a database on Udacity's website. I then exported the data as a CSV.
I then used google sheets to calculate the moving averages (over 5 years) for temperature worldwide and Los Angeles
Then I imported the CSV file to a dataframe using a jupyter notebook and ploted the average temperatures over time using Matplotlib.
Finally I created a PDF using these visualizations and made 4 observations from the datasets and visualtions
